        HOMEWORK 3 SUBMISSION TEMPLATE

        Please copy and paste your SQL queries (and potentially Python and Latex code) 
	into the appropriate spots below. 

        When submitting SQL queries, please do not include the initial 
        %sql or %%sql IPython commands. Just include the SQL code.

        DO NOT DELETE THE <![CDATA[ ... ]]> LINES IN EACH <answer> TAG!
        Doing so will break the autograder. To avoid accidentally breaking
        something, please leave all existing comments in this template
        intact in your submission.

answer = True
explanation = "If the closure of {A,B} = {A,B,C,D,E,F}, then {A,B} is a superkey. We can follow the closure algorithm to find the closure of {A,B}. A and B are in closure because of Armstrong's Axiom 1. Then D and E will be in the closure because they are dependent on D. Since D is in the closure, C and F will be in the closure as well. So, because the closure of {A,B} is {A,B,D,E,C,F}, {A,B} is the superkey."

answer = False
explanation = "To check if the decomposition is a lossless-joins, we use the Chase algorithm. After all FDs have been checked, the table looks like this: R1 = A, B, C, D1, E, R; R2 = A2, B2, C, D, E, F2; R3  = A, B3, C, D1, E, F. Because all rows still contain subscripts, the decomposition is not a lossless-join."
