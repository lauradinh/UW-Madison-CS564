CS564 Database Management Systems: Design and Implementation Fall 2022

Instructor: Paris Koutris

hw2 (ER Modeling & Schema Design) - Created a RDBMS for eBay auction data using Python and SQLite. The project required creating an Entity-Relationship model to organize the data in a logical and efficient manner, as well as using Python to parse and transform the data from its original JSON format into a load file for SQLite. I ran various SQL queries to extract and analyze the information.
